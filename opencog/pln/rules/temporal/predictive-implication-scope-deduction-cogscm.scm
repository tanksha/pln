;; Written in a more compact form (ignoring the lags) it is
;;
;; P↝ᵀ¹Q
;; (Q∧A)↝ᵀ²R
;; ⊢
;; (P≺ᵀ¹A)↝ᵀ²R
;;
;; Or simply (ignoring the lags)
;;
;; P↝Q
;; (Q∧A)↝R
;; ⊢
;; (P≺A)↝R
;;
;; Typically the first premise P↝Q contains the first part of the
;; plan, such as
;;
;; (C∧A₁)≺A₂≺A₃↝Q
;;
;; meaning, if C, the initial context is true, and A₁ is taken (at the
;; same time C is true), then A₂ is taken followed by A₃, then Q will
;; be true.
;;
;; And the second premise contains the last part of the plan, such as
;;
;; Q∧A₄↝R
;;
;; meaning, if Q, the penultimate context is true, and A₄ is taken at
;; the same time, then R will be true. Which, in this example, allows
;; to infer the full plan
;;
;; (C∧A₁)≺A₂≺A₃≺A₄↝R
;;
;; Obviously these notations should be understood in Atomese terms as
;;
;; ∧: And
;; ≺: SequentialAnd
;; ↝: PredictiveImplication[Scope]
;;
;; It should be noted that such rule is not complete in the case too
;; much uncertainty is present and failure to reach the penultimate
;; context is probable (especially if executing the last action has a
;; detrimental effect on the goal). Such complete rule would look
;; like:
;;
;; P↝Q
;; Q∧A↝R
;; ¬Q∧A↝R
;; ⊢
;; P≺A↝R
;;
;; The regular deduction rule is also incomplete for the same reason,
;; thus for now we will make the same assumption which is, in this
;; context, that R is independent of A if executed while Q is not
;; true.
;;
;; It should be noted that if executing A while Q is not true is too
;; detrimental to acheiving R, then one needs more than a sequential
;; plan. One needs a plan tree, perhaps called behavior tree, -- see
;; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_tree_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)
;; and https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Behavior_tree_(2015_Archive) for an
;; early implementational attempt in OpenCog -- as to conditionalize
;; actions based on whether an intermediate state has been reached or
;; not. Using such behavior trees as plans would allow to obtain
;; cognitive schematics with much higher chances of success than with
;; linear plans (unless the second action is "to plan", in which case
;; it would in principle create a recursion exploring all branches
;; akin to how AIXI works).
;;
;; Other implicit premises are the probabilities of P and Q (like for
;; the regular deduction rule).
